# ðŸ§  Next Word Prediction with LSTM
A deep learning-based NLP app that predicts the next word in a given text sequence using an LSTM neural network trained on Shakespeare's Hamlet.

## ðŸ“š Overview
This project showcases a neural network model capable of predicting the next word in a sequence of text, leveraging a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network. The model is trained on the complete text of Hamlet by William Shakespeare and deployed using Streamlit for interactive use.
